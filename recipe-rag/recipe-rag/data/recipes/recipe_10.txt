Title: Perfect Scrambled Eggs

Ingredients:
- 4 large eggs
- 1/4 cup whole milk or heavy cream
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- A pinch of black pepper
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter

Instructions:
1. In a medium bowl, crack the eggs. Add the milk (or cream), salt, and pepper.
2. Whisk the mixture vigorously until it's light, frothy, and uniform in color.
3. Melt the butter in a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat. Swirl the pan to coat the bottom.
4. Pour the egg mixture into the skillet. Let it sit for about 20-30 seconds, until the edges just begin to set.
5. Using a rubber spatula, gently push the eggs from the edges toward the center of the pan.
6. Continue to cook, folding and pushing the eggs, until they are cooked to your desired doneness (soft and custardy is recommended).
7. Do not overcook. The eggs will continue to cook from residual heat.
8. Remove from heat immediately and serve.
