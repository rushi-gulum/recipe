Title: Creamy Mushroom Pasta

Ingredients:
- 12 oz (340g) fettuccine or your favorite pasta
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 lb (450g) cremini mushrooms, sliced
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 cup dry white wine (or vegetable broth)
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped
- Salt and black pepper to taste

Instructions:
1. Cook the pasta according to package directions. Drain, reserving 1 cup of pasta water.
2. While pasta is cooking, heat the butter and olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
3. Add the sliced mushrooms and cook without stirring for 3-5 minutes. Then stir and continue cooking until browned and caramelized, about 5-7 more minutes.
4. Add the chopped onion and cook for 3-4 minutes until softened.
5. Add the minced garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
6. Pour in the white wine (or broth) to deglaze the pan, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom. Let it reduce by half.
7. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Stir in the heavy cream and let it simmer gently for 2-3 minutes.
8. Stir in the grated Parmesan cheese until melted and the sauce is smooth.
9. Add the cooked pasta to the skillet, along with the chopped parsley. Toss to combine.
10. If the sauce is too thick, add a splash of the reserved pasta water to reach desired consistency.
11. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.
