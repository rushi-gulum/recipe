2. Dip each slice of bread into the egg mixture, letting it soak for about 20-30 seconds per side. Don't let it get too soggy.
3. Melt the butter in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat.
4. Place the soaked bread slices in the skillet, working in batches if necessary.
5. Cook for 3-4 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through.
