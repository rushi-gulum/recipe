Title: Easy Chicken Parmesan

Ingredients:
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, halved horizontally to make 4 thin cutlets
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 large eggs, beaten
- 1 cup Italian breadcrumbs
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1 1/2 cups marinara sauce
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Instructions:
1. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
2. Set up a breading station: one plate with flour, one shallow bowl with the beaten eggs, and one plate with the breadcrumbs mixed with Parmesan cheese.
3. Season the chicken cutlets with salt and pepper.
4. Dredge each cutlet in flour, shaking off excess.
5. Dip in the egg, letting excess drip off.
6. Press into the breadcrumb mixture, coating both sides.
7. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
8. Fry the chicken cutlets for 2-3 minutes per side, until golden brown. You may need to do this in batches.
9. Place the fried cutlets in a single layer in a 9x13 baking dish.
10. Top each cutlet with a spoonful of marinara sauce.
11. Sprinkle generously with shredded mozzarella cheese.
12. Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Serve over pasta.
