Ingredients:
- 1 large head of romaine lettuce, chopped
- 1 cup croutons
- 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

For the Dressing:
- 2 anchovy fillets, minced (or 1 teaspoon anchovy paste)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 1/4 cup lemon juice, fresh
- 1 egg yolk (use pasteurized if concerned about raw eggs)

- Salt and black pepper to taste

Instructions:
1. To make the dressing, whisk together the anchovy fillets, minced garlic, Dijon mustard, lemon juice, and egg yolk in a medium bowl.
2. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil while whisking continuously until the dressing is emulsified and creamy.
3. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
4. In a large salad bowl, add the chopped romaine lettuce.
5. Pour about half of the dressing over the lettuce and toss to coat. Add more dressing as needed, but don't oversaturate.
6. Add the croutons and half of the Parmesan cheese. Toss gently one more time.
7. Serve immediately, topped with the remaining Parmesan cheese.
