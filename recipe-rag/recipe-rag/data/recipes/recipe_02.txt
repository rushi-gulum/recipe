Title: Simple Roast Chicken

Ingredients:
- 1 (4-5 lb) whole chicken
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 lemon, halved
- 4 cloves garlic, whole
- 2 sprigs fresh rosemary
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper

Instructions:
1. Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).
2. Remove any giblets from the chicken and pat the outside dry with paper towels.
3. In a small bowl, mix the softened butter, olive oil, salt, and pepper to create a paste.
4. Gently loosen the skin from the chicken breasts and thighs. Rub half of the butter mixture under the skin.
5. Rub the remaining butter mixture all over the outside of the chicken.
6. Stuff the chicken cavity with the halved lemon, whole garlic cloves, and rosemary sprigs.
7. Place the chicken in a roasting pan, breast side up.
8. Roast for 20 minutes at 425°F (220°C).
9. Reduce the oven temperature to 375°F (190°C) and continue roasting for another 40-50 minutes, or until the juices run clear and a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh reads 165°F (74°C).
10. Let the chicken rest for 10-15 minutes before carving.
