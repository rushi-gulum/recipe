Title: Fluffy Pancakes

Ingredients:
- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 1/4 cups milk
- 1 large egg
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)

Instructions:
1. In a large bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
2. In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract (if using).
3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Whisk gently until just combined. Do not overmix; a few lumps are okay.
4. Let the batter rest for 5-10 minutes.
5. Heat a lightly oiled griddle or non-stick pan over medium-low heat.
6. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake.
7. Cook for 2-3 minutes, or until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set.
8. Flip the pancake and cook for another 1-2 minutes on the other side, until golden brown.
9. Repeat with the remaining batter. Serve warm with butter and maple syrup.
