Title: Chicken Alfredo

Ingredients:
- 12 oz fettuccine pasta
- 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into strips
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 1/2 cups heavy cream
- 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped

Instructions:
1. Cook the fettuccine according to package directions. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup of pasta water.
2. Season the chicken strips with salt and pepper.
3. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until golden brown and cooked through (5-7 minutes). Remove chicken to a plate.
4. In the same skillet, reduce heat to medium. Melt the butter.
5. Add the minced garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
6. Slowly whisk in the heavy cream. Bring to a simmer and cook for 3-5 minutes, until it thickens slightly.
7. Remove from heat. Whisk in the grated Parmesan cheese until the sauce is smooth.
8. Add the cooked pasta and the cooked chicken back to the skillet.
9. Toss to combine, adding a splash of reserved pasta water if the sauce is too thick.
10. Stir in the fresh parsley. Season with more salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.
