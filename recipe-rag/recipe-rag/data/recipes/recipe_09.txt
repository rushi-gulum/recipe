Title: Simple Chocolate Chip Cookies

Ingredients:
- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup packed brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 large eggs
- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups (12 oz) semi-sweet chocolate chips

Instructions:
1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy (about 3-4 minutes).
3. Beat in the vanilla extract and then the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition.
4. In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt.
5. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed until just combined. Do not overmix.
6. Stir in the chocolate chips by hand.
7. Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, about 2 inches apart.
8. Bake for 9-11 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the centers are still slightly soft.
9. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
