Title: Simple Macaroni and Cheese

Ingredients:
- 1/2 lb (8 oz) elbow macaroni
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 cups whole milk
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 2 cups (8 oz) shredded sharp cheddar cheese

Instructions:
1. Cook the macaroni according to package directions. Drain and return to the pot.
2. While the pasta is cooking, make the cheese sauce. In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
3. Whisk in the flour and cook for 1 minute, whisking constantly.
4. Slowly pour in the milk, whisking continuously to prevent lumps.
5. Cook, whisking often, until the sauce thickens and bubbles, about 5-7 minutes.
6. Remove the sauce from the heat. Stir in the salt, pepper, and shredded cheddar cheese until the cheese is fully melted and the sauce is smooth.
7. Pour the cheese sauce over the cooked macaroni in the pot.
8. Stir until the pasta is well coated.
9. Serve immediately.
