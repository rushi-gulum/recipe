Title: Roasted Brussels Sprouts

Ingredients:
- 1 lb Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 tablespoon balsamic glaze (optional)

Instructions:
1. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
2. In a large bowl, toss the halved Brussels sprouts with the olive oil, salt, and pepper until evenly coated.
3. Spread the Brussels sprouts in a single layer on a large, rimmed baking sheet. Make sure they are cut-side down for best caramelization.
4. Roast for 20-25 minutes, shaking the pan halfway through, until they are tender and the outer leaves are crispy and caramelized.
5. Remove from the oven. If using, drizzle with the balsamic glaze and toss to coat.
6. Serve immediately.
