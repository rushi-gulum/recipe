Title: Simple Tomato Pasta

Ingredients:
- 1 lb (450g) spaghetti
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 (28 oz) can crushed tomatoes
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 pinch red pepper flakes (optional)
- Salt, to taste
- Black pepper, to taste
- Grated Parmesan cheese, for serving

Instructions:
1. Cook the spaghetti according to package directions. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup of pasta water.
2. While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
3. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5-7 minutes.
4. Add the minced garlic and red pepper flakes (if using) and cook for another 1 minute until fragrant.
5. Pour in the crushed tomatoes, basil, and oregano. Stir to combine.
6. Bring the sauce to a simmer, then reduce heat and let it cook for at least 15 minutes to let the flavors meld.
7. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.
8. Add the cooked spaghetti to the skillet with the sauce. Toss to combine, adding a splash of the reserved pasta water if the sauce is too thick.
9. Serve hot, topped with grated Parmesan cheese.
