Title: Perfect Grilled Cheese Sandwich

Ingredients:
- 2 slices of white or sourdough bread
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
- 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese
- 2 slices provolone cheese

Instructions:
1. Lay the two slices of bread on a cutting board.
2. Spread the softened butter on one side of each slice of bread.
3. Place one slice of bread, butter-side-down, in a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat.
4. Layer the cheeses onto the bread: start with the provolone, then sprinkle the cheddar on top.
5. Place the second slice of bread on top, butter-side-up.
6. Cook for 3-5 minutes, until the bottom slice is golden brown and crispy.
7. Carefully flip the sandwich with a spatula.
8. Cook for another 3-5 minutes, until the second side is golden brown and the cheese is fully melted.
9. Remove from skillet, slice in half diagonally, and serve immediately.
