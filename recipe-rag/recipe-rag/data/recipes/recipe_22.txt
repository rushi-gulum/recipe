Title: Classic Beef Burger

Ingredients:
- 1 lb ground beef (80/20)
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 4 burger buns
- 4 slices cheddar cheese
- Toppings: lettuce, tomato slices, onion slices, pickles

Instructions:
1. Divide the ground beef into 4 equal portions (1/4 lb each).
2. Gently form each portion into a patty, slightly larger than the bun. Don't overwork the meat.
3. Make a slight indentation in the center of each patty with your thumb. This prevents it from puffing up.
4. Season both sides of the patties generously with salt and pepper.
5. Heat a grill or large skillet over medium-high heat.
6. Cook the patties for 3-5 minutes per side for medium-rare to medium.
7. In the last minute of cooking, top each patty with a slice of cheddar cheese and let it melt.
8. Toast the burger buns on the grill or skillet for 30-60 seconds.
9. Assemble the burgers: Place the cooked patty on the bottom bun, add your desired toppings, and cover with the top bun.
