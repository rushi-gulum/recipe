Title: Classic French Omelette

Ingredients:
- 3 large eggs
- 1 tablespoon water or milk
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- A pinch of black pepper
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 1/4 cup shredded Gruyere or Swiss cheese (optional)

Instructions:
1. Crack the eggs into a bowl. Add the water (or milk), salt, and pepper.
2. Whisk vigorously until the eggs are light and frothy.
3. Melt the butter in an 8-inch non-stick skillet over medium-low heat. Swirl to coat the pan.
4. Pour the egg mixture into the skillet. Let it set for 30 seconds.
5. Use a rubber spatula to gently pull the cooked edges toward the center, tilting the pan to let the uncooked egg fill the space.
6. Continue this process for 1-2 minutes, until the eggs are mostly set but still slightly moist on top.
7. If using cheese, sprinkle it over one half of the omelette.
8. Carefully fold the other half of the omelette over the cheese.
9. Slide the omelette onto a plate and serve immediately.
